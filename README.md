# RaffleWheel

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to facilitate raffles by retrieving participant information from a Google Sheet and selecting a winner using a spinning wheel.

## Features
- Fetch participant names from a Google Sheet using the Google API.
- Visual spinning wheel to randomly pick a winner.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- Google API credentials for Sheets access

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RaffleWheel.git
   cd RaffleWheel
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Google Sheets API credentials and update `fetchNames.py` accordingly.

## Usage
### Fetching Participants
Run the script to retrieve names from Google Sheets:
```sh
python fetchNames.py
```
This will fetch participant names and save them in a format usable by the spinning wheel.
